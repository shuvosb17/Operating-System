# 📘 Lecture 3 Notes

## **What Is an Operating System? (The Core Idea)**

---

## 🖥️ Assumption: Our Computer System

```
CPU  ⇄  RAM  ⇄  Hard Disk
```

### Given:

* 🧠 **RAM capacity** = can hold **50 programs**
* 💾 **Hard Disk capacity** = holds **500 programs**
* CPU ❌ cannot access Hard Disk directly
* CPU ✅ can access **RAM only**

---

## ❓ The BIG Question (Very Important)

> Out of **500 programs** in Hard Disk,
> 👉 **which 50 programs should be moved into RAM?**

Because:

* CPU executes programs **only from RAM**
* RAM space is **limited**
* We **cannot load everything**

🔥 This question **creates the need for an Operating System**

---

## 🧠 Naive Idea (Sounds Good, But Impossible)

> “Let’s load the 50 programs that CPU will need next”

❌ Problem:

* We **cannot predict the future**
* CPU can request **any program anytime**

👉 So we must **GUESS intelligently**

---

## 🔮 Solution: Prediction Using Algorithms

* We **predict** which programs are likely to be needed
* We use **algorithms**
* These algorithms are written **inside the Operating System**

📌 OS = **Big program**
📌 Scheduler = **Small function inside OS**

---

## 🧩 Long-Term Scheduler (First OS Function)

### 🎯 What Does It Do?

* Selects **50 programs**
* From **500 programs in Hard Disk**
* Moves them into **RAM**

```
Hard Disk (500 programs)
        ↓
 Long Term Scheduler
        ↓
RAM (50 programs)
```

👉 This function is called:

## 🟢 **Long-Term Scheduler**

---

## ⚙️ Why Is This Called Resource Allocation?

### 🧠 What Is a Resource?

Any hardware device:

* CPU
* RAM
* Hard Disk
* Printer
* Mouse

📌 **Here the resource = RAM**

* 500 programs want RAM
* Only 50 can get it
* OS decides **who gets it**

👉 This is **Resource Allocation / Resource Management**

---

## 🔁 Another Scenario: CPU Scheduling

### Assume:

* RAM already has **2 processes**

  * P1
  * P2

Both are:

* Ready
* Waiting for CPU

```
CPU
 ↑
P1   P2   (Both waiting)
```

❓ **Which process should CPU execute first?**

---

## 🧠 Important Clarification

For now:

* Program ≈ Process
  (minor difference, explained later)

---

## 🧩 Short-Term Scheduler (Second OS Function)

### 🎯 What Does It Do?

* Chooses **which process gets CPU next**
* CPU is the **resource**
* Multiple processes are competing

```
RAM (P1, P2)
      ↓
 Short Term Scheduler
      ↓
CPU (One process executes)
```

👉 This function is called:

## 🔵 **Short-Term Scheduler**

---

## ⚙️ How Does OS Decide?

Using **algorithms**, for example:

* Process with **smallest size**
* Process with **largest size**
* Process that **came first** (FCFS)
* Many more…

📌 Algorithm depends on **OS design**

---

## 🔑 Very Important Insight

> ❗ Everyone will get the resource eventually
> ❗ But **who gets it FIRST** matters

Examples:

* All 500 programs will reach RAM
* All processes will get CPU
* OS decides **order & priority**

---

## 🧠 What Is the Operating System? (Final Definition)

> 🔥 **Operating System is a big program whose MAIN job is:**
>
> 👉 **Resource Allocation / Resource Management**

Resources include:

* RAM
* CPU
* Hard Disk
* I/O devices

---

## 🧩 OS = Collection of Schedulers

```
Operating System
   ├── Long Term Scheduler (Hard Disk → RAM)
   ├── Short Term Scheduler (RAM → CPU)
   ├── Other Resource Managers
```

## 🏁 Final Takeaways (EXAM + INTERVIEW GOLD 🏆)

* ✅ OS exists because **resources are limited**
* ✅ OS decides **who gets what and when**
* ✅ RAM & CPU are critical resources
* ✅ Long-Term Scheduler → selects programs into RAM
* ✅ Short-Term Scheduler → selects process for CPU
* ✅ Core function of OS = **Resource Management**

Now that you understand **WHY OS exists**, next topics will cover:

* Process vs Program (properly)
* Scheduling algorithms
* Multiprogramming
* Performance improvements
