## 🧠 Recap (1 Line)

> **Operating System = Resource Manager**

And the **most important thing now** 👇

---

## 🧠 Operating System Lives in RAM (Always!)

### 🔑 Very Important Rule

* OS is also a **program**
* But unlike other programs:

  * ✅ It is loaded into RAM **when the computer starts**
  * ✅ It **never leaves RAM**
  * ❌ It is not removed like other programs

```
RAM
├── OS Code Space   ← Always present
└── User Space     ← Applications
```

---

## 🧩 Memory Division in RAM

### 🟦 OS Space (Kernel Space)

* Contains **Operating System code**
* Handles:

  * Scheduling
  * Resource allocation
  * I/O management

### 🟩 User Space

* Application programs:

  * P1, P2, P3
  * MS Word
  * Calculator
  * Chrome

📌 **Applications come and go**
📌 **OS stays forever**

## 🔁 How a Program Executes (Full Flow)

```
Source Code
   ↓ Compiler
Machine Code (.exe)
   ↓
Hard Disk
   ↓ (when needed)
RAM (User Space)
   ↓
CPU executes instruction-by-instruction
   ↓
Program finishes
   ↓
Removed from RAM
```

✔️ RAM space becomes free
✔️ Another program can use it

## ⌨️🖥️ How I/O Devices Work (Key Idea)

### 🔹 What Are I/O Devices?

* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Monitor
* Printer
* Hard Disk

👉 **Every I/O device has a BUFFER**

> 🧠 **Buffer = temporary memory / register**

---

## 🧮 Example 1: Calculator (2 + 3)

### Step-by-step (Binary Level)

```
Keyboard input: 2 → 010
Keyboard buffer
        ↓
RAM
        ↓
CPU Registers
        ↓
ALU performs addition
        ↓
Result: 5 → 101
        ↓
RAM
        ↓
Monitor buffer
        ↓
Screen output
```

---

### 🧠 Who Does the Calculation?

CPU has:

* **Control Unit** (not important now)
* **ALU (Arithmetic & Logic Unit)** ✅

ALU performs:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Logical operations

---

## 📝 Example 2: Editing a Word Document

```
Hard Disk
   ↓
Word Document loaded into RAM
   ↓
MS Word program loaded into RAM
   ↓
CPU executes MS Word
   ↓
Keyboard input → buffer → RAM
   ↓
Document modified
   ↓
Save
   ↓
RAM → Hard Disk
```

## 🔑 Important Insight About Hard Disk

> 💡 **Hard Disk is BOTH:**

* Input device (read file)
* Output device (save file)

| Device    | Input | Output |
| --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Keyboard  | ✅     | ❌      |
| Monitor   | ❌     | ✅      |
| Hard Disk | ✅     | ✅      |

---

## 🔄 I/O Event (VERY IMPORTANT TERM)

When a program:

* Is in RAM
* But **waiting to read/write data**
* From/to I/O devices

👉 This is called an **I/O Event**

📌 Program is **not executing**
📌 CPU is **not being used by it**

---

## 🧠 What Can a Program Do in RAM?

Once loaded into RAM, a program can be in **3 situations**:

### 1️⃣ Execution (CPU Burst)

* CPU is executing instructions
* Also called **Burst Time**

### 2️⃣ I/O Event

* Waiting for:

  * Keyboard
  * Disk
  * Monitor
* CPU is **not used**

### 3️⃣ Waiting

* Waiting for:

  * CPU
  * I/O completion
  * Some event

```

## ⏱️ Turnaround Time (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

### 📌 Definition

> **Turnaround Time = Total time program spends in RAM**

---

### 🧮 Formula

```
Turnaround Time =
Waiting Time
+ Burst Time (Execution Time)
+ I/O Time
```

---

### 🕒 Simple Example

* Program P1 loaded into RAM at **1 AM**
* Program finished at **3 AM**

```
Turnaround Time = 2 hours
```

During these 2 hours:

* Sometimes waiting
* Sometimes executing
* Sometimes doing I/O

📌 Order does **NOT matter**
📌 Combination matters

---

## ⚠️ Important Clarification

* Execution, Waiting, I/O:

  * Can happen in **any order**
  * Depends on program behavior

👉 That’s why **scheduling algorithms exist**

---

## 🧠 Why This Concept Matters

Because later you will study:

* CPU Scheduling
* Waiting time calculation
* Turnaround time optimization
* Performance comparison of algorithms

🔥 **This formula will be used MANY times**

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaways (Must Remember)

* ✅ OS is always resident in RAM
* ✅ RAM is divided into OS space & User space
* ✅ Every I/O device has a buffer
* ✅ Programs can wait, execute, or do I/O
* ✅ Turnaround time = Waiting + Execution + I/O
* ✅ Scheduling controls performance

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next?

Now we’re fully ready for:

* Process states (New, Ready, Running, Waiting)
* CPU Scheduling Algorithms
* Multiprogramming performance analysis
