# 📘 Lecture 2 Notes

## **How a Program Is Executed (Hard Disk → RAM → CPU)**

---

## 🖥️ Our Computer System (Assumption)

```
+-------------------+
|       CPU         |
+-------------------+
        ↑
        |
+-------------------+
|       RAM         |
+-------------------+
        ↑
        |
+-------------------+
|    Hard Disk      |
+-------------------+
```

👉 These **three components** decide how fast your program runs.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: What Is a High-Level Program?

### 💻 High-Level Programs

These are programs **written by humans**:

* C
* Java
* Python
* Chrome
* Photoshop
* Any application you use

📌 These programs are **easy for humans**, ❌ **not for CPU**

---

## ❌ CPU Cannot Understand High-Level Programs

> ❗ **CPU understands ONLY:**
> 👉 `1`s and `0`s (Binary)

So this will NOT work directly:

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

CPU wants:

```
1010101010101010
```

---

## 🔁 Step 2: High-Level → Machine Code

### 🛠️ Compiler (Very Important)

* Compiler is **also a program**
* Converts:

```
High-Level Program
        ↓
Machine Code (1s & 0s)
```

### 🔹 Machine Code Names

* Machine code
* Executable code
* `.exe`
* Low-level program

📌 **Only machine code is stored in Hard Disk**

---

## 💾 Step 3: Program in Hard Disk

✔️ Every program:

* Is stored in **Hard Disk**
* Stored in **Machine Code**
* Is **permanent**

📌 But there is a BIG problem 👇

---

## ❌ CPU Cannot Access Hard Disk Directly

> 🔥 **CRITICAL RULE**
> ❌ CPU → Hard Disk ❌
> ✅ CPU → RAM ✅

So CPU execution path is **ONLY**:

```
CPU → RAM → Execute
```

---

## 🧠 Step 4: RAM Size vs Hard Disk Size

| Component | Typical Size  | Cost         | Speed        |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| RAM       | 4–16 GB       | 💰 Expensive | ⚡ Very Fast  |
| Hard Disk | 500 GB – 2 TB | 💰 Cheap     | 🐢 Very Slow |

📌 Because RAM is **costly**, it is **small**
📌 Because Hard Disk is **cheap**, it is **huge**

---

## ❓ Why Can’t We Put All Programs in RAM?

Because:

* Hard Disk has **thousands of programs**
* RAM is **too small**
* ❌ Impossible to load everything

👉 So we load **ONLY what is needed**

---

## 🧩 Step 5: When CPU Wants to Execute Program `P1`

### 🔍 Case 1: Program `P1` Is Already in RAM ✅

```
CPU
 ↓
RAM (P1 found)
 ↓
Execute
```

✔️ Very fast
✔️ Only RAM access
✔️ No delay

---

### 🐢 Case 2: Program `P1` Is NOT in RAM ❌

```
CPU requests P1
        ↓
RAM (Not Found)
        ↓
Hard Disk (Found)
        ↓ copy
RAM
        ↓
CPU executes
```

❌ Slow
❌ Hard Disk access involved
❌ Takes LOT of time

---

## ⏱️ Why Is This Case Slow?

Because:

* Hard Disk is **very very slow**
* CPU must:

  * Access Hard Disk
  * Copy program to RAM
  * Then execute

📌 RAM is fast
📌 Hard Disk is the **bottleneck**

---

## 📊 Visual Summary (Access Time Comparison)

```
If program in RAM:
CPU → RAM → Execute   ⚡ FAST

If program in Hard Disk:
CPU → RAM (miss)
     → Hard Disk (slow)
     → RAM
     → CPU executes   🐢 SLOW
```

## 🔑 Key Observations (VERY IMPORTANT)

* ✔️ CPU **cannot** access Hard Disk directly
* ✔️ Program must be in **RAM** to execute
* ✔️ RAM is **fast but costly**
* ✔️ Hard Disk is **slow but cheap**
* ✔️ Program execution speed depends on:
  👉 **Whether program is already in RAM or not**

---

## 🧠 Why This Lecture Is SUPER IMPORTANT

Because later you will learn:

* 🚦 **Multiprogramming**
* 📄 **Paging**
* 🧠 **Caching**
* ⚙️ **Process scheduling**

And ALL of them try to:

> 🔥 **Keep the required programs in RAM as much as possible**

---

## 🎯 One-Line Takeaway (Exam Gold 🏆)

> **Programs run fast when they are already in RAM,
> and slow when they need to be loaded from Hard Disk.**
