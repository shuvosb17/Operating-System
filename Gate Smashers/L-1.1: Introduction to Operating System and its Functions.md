## 🧠 What You’ll Learn from These Notes

By the end of this document, you’ll **clearly understand**:

* What an **Operating System (OS)** really is
* **Why** we need an OS (what breaks without it)
* The **primary goals** of an OS
* **Core functionalities** of an OS (exam + real-world oriented)
* How users actually interact with hardware **without realizing it**
* The role of **system calls** (very important for OS theory & GATE)

---

## 1️⃣ What is an Operating System?

### 📌 Definition

An **Operating System** is a **system software** that acts as an **interface between the user and computer hardware**.

💡 **In simple words**:

> The OS is like a **translator + manager** that helps humans use machines easily.

---

### 🧩 Text-Based Visualization (Very Important)

```
USER
 ↓
APPLICATIONS (Word, Browser, Games)
 ↓
OPERATING SYSTEM
 ↓
HARDWARE (CPU, RAM, Disk, Keyboard, Printer)
```

👉 The user **never talks directly** to hardware.
👉 The OS stands in between and handles everything smoothly.

## 2️⃣ What Comes Under Hardware?

### 🖥️ Hardware Components Explained

* **CPU** → Brain of the system (executes instructions)
* **RAM** → Main memory (temporary, fast)
* **Hard Disk / SSD** → Permanent storage
* **Input Devices** → Keyboard, mouse, scanner
* **Output Devices** → Monitor, printer, speakers

❓ **Question**:
Does the user control these directly?
❌ **No** — the OS does it for us.

---

## 3️⃣ Why Do We Need an Operating System?

### ❌ Scenario WITHOUT an OS (Nightmare 😵)

If there were **no operating system**:

* You must write a **separate program** to:

  * Print a document
  * Use the keyboard
  * Run a program on CPU
* For every new device → new program
* No authority to:

  * Take hardware back from a user
  * Share CPU or memory fairly

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a **railway station without a station master** 🚆

* Anyone can occupy tracks
* No scheduling
* Total chaos

➡️ **OS = Station Master**

---

## 4️⃣ Core Goals of an Operating System

### 🎯 Primary Goals

| Goal                        | Meaning                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Convenience**             | Make hardware easy to use      |
| **Efficiency (Throughput)** | Execute more work in less time |

---

### 📈 What is Throughput?

> **Throughput = Number of tasks completed per unit time**

```
More tasks done in less time → Higher throughput
```

---

## 5️⃣ Real-Life Operating System Examples

### 💻 Popular Operating Systems

* **Microsoft Windows**

  * Famous for **ease of use**
  * Dominated market due to convenience
* **Linux**

  * High **throughput**
  * Preferred for servers & performance
* **macOS**

  * Balanced performance + UI

📌 Trend:

* Earlier → Convenience mattered more
* Now → **Speed + efficiency + scalability**

## 6️⃣ Major Functionalities of an Operating System

> These are the **real reasons** OS exists 👇

---

## 🟢 1. Resource Management (Resource Governor)

![Image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230427192834/resize.png)

![Image](https://devtools.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Modern-Steps-Project-Management-Process-Infographic-Graph.png)

### 🔹 What Resources?

* CPU
* RAM
* Disk
* I/O Devices

### 🧠 What OS Does

* Decides **who gets what**
* Decides **how long**
* Takes resources back after use

### 🧪 Example

On a **server**:

* 100 users request data
* OS allocates CPU & memory **fairly**
* Prevents overload

📌 Task Manager showing CPU/RAM usage = OS at work

---

## 🟢 2. Process Management (CPU Scheduling)

![Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A1170/1%2AUETMeBR3EQuDEMcOA7VW5w.png)

### 🔹 What is a Process?

A **program in execution**.

```
program.c → compile → run → PROCESS
```

### 🧠 Problem

Many processes want CPU **at the same time**.

### 🔧 Solution

OS uses **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:

* FCFS
* SJF
* Round Robin
* Priority Scheduling

➡️ OS decides:

* Which process runs
* For how long
* In what order

---

## 🟢 3. Storage Management (File System)

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/media/file-system-structure.png)

### 🔹 Storage Means

* Hard disk / SSD
* Permanent data

### 🧠 OS Responsibilities

* Organize data
* Store files in:

  * Tracks
  * Sectors
* Provide file systems like:

  * NTFS
  * FAT
  * NFS
  * CIFS

📌 Without OS → disk is useless raw metal

---

## 🟢 4. Memory Management (RAM Handling)

![Image](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/Memory-Management-in-OS-image01.jpg)

### 🔹 Why Separate from Storage?

* RAM is **limited**
* Faster than disk
* All processes must come to RAM first

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* Allocation
* Deallocation
* Swapping
* Multitasking

### 🔄 Text Diagram

```
Disk → RAM → CPU
```

### 🧪 Example

* Process finished ❌
* OS removes it from RAM
* Brings new process

📌 Prevents RAM from getting full forever

---

## 🟢 5. Security & Privacy

### 🔐 Security Features

* Login passwords
* Authentication
* Memory protection

### 🧠 Memory Protection Example

```
P1 → Memory 0–100
P2 → Memory 101–200
```

If P2 tries to access memory of P1 → ❌ BLOCKED

➡️ OS prevents:

* Data corruption
* Process interference

---

## 7️⃣ How Do Users Access the OS?

### 🧭 Two Ways

#### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

* Desktop
* Icons
* Mouse clicks

Example:

* Ctrl + P → Print
* OS silently talks to printer

#### 2. Command Line Interface (CLI)

![Image](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/52881909218_15f72bb07c_o.jpg)

* Windows → Command Prompt
* Linux → Terminal

Commands invoke **system calls**

---

## 8️⃣ System Calls (VERY IMPORTANT ⚠️)

### 🔹 What is a System Call?

A **bridge** between:

```
Application ↔ Operating System ↔ Hardware
```

### 🔹 Examples

* `open()`
* `read()`
* `write()`
* `close()`

🧠 When you double-click a file:

* You don’t see it
* But OS uses `open()` internally

---
